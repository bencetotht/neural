# Neural - Machine Learning & Neural Network Projects

A comprehensive collection of machine learning, neural network, and quantitative trading projects implemented in Python, with various deep learning frameworks. 

## ## 📚 Learning Resources
The repository contains both projects of my own and learning projects, which I created by following online materials. I tried linking most of them, credit to all of the uploaders.

I followed Andrej Karpathy's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) playlist, can highly recommend for getting started with neural networks.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a diverse set of projects covering:
- **Neural Networks**: Implementations using PyTorch, Keras, and custom frameworks
- **Machine Learning**: Classification, regression, and unsupervised learning projects
- **Computer Vision**: Image classification and face detection models
- **Natural Language Processing**: Sentiment analysis and text processing
- **Quantitative Trading**: Algorithmic trading strategies, sentiment analysis, and market prediction

This repository also contains several work-in-progress projects that will be further developed and expanded in the future.
